# Github Notes

## Git: Version control software (application)
* Git is a system you can use to  keep track of the history of a project and allow many people to collaborate on the project together. 
* Solutions to 2 problems:
   * Version control: change/add things (through the history) without messing up the flow of a project
   * Collaboration: Multiple people can work together on the same project in real-time

## Github: Web service/website
* Essentially doing git on a server (behind the scenes→ social coding)
* Social network for projects that are managed through git

## Repository (repo): Synonym for "project" 
* A location where files are stored (repository of files)
* Multiple files can be associated with it

## Commit: “Saves” your work
* After making a change to a file→  make commit
* Allows you to browse the history 
* Each commit has a unique identifier representing it (hash)
